# scrolly.to

> AI-powered interactive visual explainers that break down complex topics into scroll-driven, animated single-page apps.

scrolly.to is an open-source Claude Code skill that generates interactive visual explainers. Given any complex topic — an algorithm, a business model, a technical concept — it produces a self-contained, scroll-driven single-page app with animated SVG diagrams, interactive widgets, and editorial typography.

## Key Facts

- Free and open source (MIT license)
- Works as a Claude Code skill: `/scrolly "Your topic"`
- Generates a complete Next.js app or standalone HTML file
- No design skills or coding required
- Output includes: animated SVG diagrams, interactive sliders/toggles, dark/light theming, responsive layout
- Deployed explainers are static — host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)

## Example Explainers

- Seed2.0 LLM — How ByteDance's frontier model works: https://jerrysoer.github.io/seed2-explainer/
- Claude Model Lineup — Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus compared: https://jerrysoer.github.io/claude-models-explainer-v2/

## How It Works

1. Pick a topic (e.g., "How TCP/IP works")
2. Run `/scrolly "How TCP/IP works"` in Claude Code
3. The AI generates a complete visual explainer with animations and interactive diagrams
4. Output is a single self-contained app — deploy anywhere

## Template Types

- how-it-works — Technical process explanation (protocols, infrastructure)
- business-model — Company/business model breakdown (revenue, flywheel)
- concept — Abstract concept visualization (network effects, compounding)
- comparison — Side-by-side comparison (REST vs GraphQL)
- timeline — Chronological/sequential process (startup scaling)
