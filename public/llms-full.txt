# scrolly.to — Full Documentation

> AI-powered interactive visual explainers that break down complex topics into scroll-driven, animated single-page apps.

## Overview

scrolly.to is an open-source Claude Code skill that transforms complex technical concepts into beautiful, interactive single-page explainers. Each generated explainer follows the FT Visual Storytelling scrollytelling pattern: a sticky diagram stays fixed while narrative text scrolls alongside it, with the diagram transforming in response to the reader's scroll position.

## Installation

```
claude skill install scrolly
```

Then run:
```
/scrolly "Your topic here"
```

## Template Types

The skill auto-detects the best template for your topic, or you can specify one:

- **how-it-works** — Technical process explanation (e.g., how TCP/IP works, how Docker containers work). Linear progression through stages/layers with flow diagrams and step-through simulators.
- **business-model** — Company/business model breakdown (e.g., how Stripe makes money). Revenue streams, unit economics, flywheel diagrams, revenue calculators.
- **concept** — Abstract concept visualization (e.g., network effects, product-market fit). Visual metaphors, growth curves, interactive parameter exploration.
- **comparison** — Side-by-side comparison (e.g., REST vs GraphQL). Split-view diagrams, decision trees, toggle switches between options.
- **timeline** — Chronological/sequential process (e.g., how a startup scales). Timeline visualizations, milestone markers, era selectors.

## Architecture

- Next.js 15+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- Static export for GitHub Pages deployment
- Recharts for data visualizations, Lucide React for icons
- All data pre-computed at build time (no backend)
- Full light/dark theme support
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

## Design Philosophy

- Editorial, not textbook — headlines are evocative, not descriptive
- Show, don't tell — every concept has an interactive element
- Progressive disclosure — start simple, let users dig deeper
- Layman-first — everyday analogies before technical jargon
- One idea per scroll step — never overload the reader
- Warm cream canvas with editorial serif typography (FT-inspired)

## Output

Each generation produces:
1. A deployable Next.js app (or standalone HTML)
2. A companion JSON file with structured section data for revisions, exports, and analytics

## Example Explainers
